## VIS for Contact Tracing Modelling

This folder contains a series of outputs from the static dynamic graph drawing / graph analysis work.

There are a series of `pdfs` that are visualisations of the network produced through Gephi. In addition to that, there are also `.graphml` outputs for the generated networks.
