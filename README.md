# scrc-vis-modelling
This is a repository for collating the visual analytics applications built by the visualisation team to support the different modelling teams. Each folder is a separate stream of activity in support of different modelling efforts within SCRC.

## How to include your contribution?

You can upload your visualisation solutions by creating a folder under this repository. The protoypes can work with any language and on any part of the available data. Please make sure that you choose a short but descriptive name and include a short readme.md file to describe the effort. If your code produced visuals, it would be great if you can embed a screenshot in the readme file so that we have a visual collection for those who want to quicky browse through what is being built. You can include build guidelines if relevant. 

Below is a template to populate the README file under each folder:
